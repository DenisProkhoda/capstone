# How can corruption and alcohol abuse affect suicides worldwide?

## Introduction 

In this project I will examine two hypothesis – I want to find the connection between suicide rate and alcoholism in different countries, along with suicide rate and corruption index. I strongly believe that suicide rates are lower in countries with lower levels of corruption and alcohol consumptions. From my point of view, corruption and alcohol abuse have a detrimental effect on societal well-being, including mental health.
I will look at number of recent national surveys that helped shed light on the relationship between alcohol and suicidal behavior. I will also analyze CPI (Corruption Perception Index) in different countries to find relationship between high suicide rate in those countries that suffer from high level of corruption.



## Question

•	What are the countries with the highest suicide rate?  
•	Is the alcohol consumption in the countries with the highest suicide rate above or below average?  
•	Is the CPI in the countries with the highest suicide rate above or below average?  
•	What are the top 10 countries where suicide rate decreased from 2010 to 2018?  
•	Is alcohol consumption decreased in these countries?  
•	Is CPI increased in these countries?  
•	What are the top 10 countries where suicide rate increased from 2010 to 2018?  
•	Is alcohol consumption increased in these countries from 2010 to 2018?  
•	Is CPI decreased in these countries from 2010 to 2018?  
•	Does alcohol consumption increase the risk for suicide?  
•	Does corruption affect suicide?
